        <p>Hi, my name is Dale Nell. I have lived in Pennsylvania my whole life in a small town called Columbia. I am currently attending Thaddus stevens for computer software engineering. I got my high school diploma from Columbia high school, and I also did a year in the Browns town CTC campus for digital design and print media. Though high school all my free time was put into sport but now I mainly spend time with family and friends and working on class work.  </p>
